This course presumes that you have some basic knowledge of computer programming and especially Python.
If you are starting from scratch then you will need to complete an 'intro to python' course elsewhere.
The basic knowledge required is an understanding of object and data structures, comparison operators, statements, 
methods and functions, error handling, try-except-finally, object-oriented programming (classes).
