Introduction
============

In this course you will learn the basics of creative computing for music.
It will take you through the application of code in creative explorations of
MIDI, audio and I/O communications.

The GitHub repository to support this course is https://github.com/CreativeCoding/course

prerequisites to the course
---------------------------

This course presumes that you have some basic knowledge of computer programming and especially Python.
If you are starting from scratch then you will need to complete an 'intro to python' course elsewhere.
The basic knowledge required is an understanding of:

+ object and data structures,
+ comparison operators,
+ statements,
+ methods and functions,
+ error handling,
+ try-except-finally,
+ object-oriented programming (classes).

It is presumed that you will be using this IDE for:

+ environment management,
+ importing libraries,
+ and navigating the Terminal.

You will need to know how to do these before moving on with the course. If you need to "catch-up", here are some good
links:

+ Download Python https://realpython.com/installing-python/
+ Setting up environments https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/
+ Importing libraries with pip https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/

Format of lessons
-----------------

Each lesson pretty much focuses on a single library or single use of a library. These are split into 3 main
activities:

    1. **CONCEPT** e.g. an explanation of a "hello world" use
    2. **TASK** e.g. a walkthrough of a creative music application
    3. **EXTRA CREDIT**: e.g. extended discussion of the library's API

What is creative coding?
------------------------

+ "Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional."
+ "Creative Coding is a process, based on exploration, iteration, reflection and discovery, where code is used as the primary medium to create a wide range of media artifacts."
+ "Creative coding uses software, code and computational processes to be expressive or to create art forms."

As highlighted by these statements, creative coding can be described in many ways. In essence it is using to code to make a computer do something creative.
This could be to get the computer to produce something creative, such as an artwork or a song, or to get it to help you make
something creative by working with you in the process, or it could be a tool that realises your creative ideas.

Whatever you decide to do will need to be built in a computer language so that the computer knows what to do. As such,
creative computing requires technical skill in coding and an understanding of the creative aesthetics that is possible
with computers.

Coding involves problem solving, writing algorithms in steps, sometimes using maths and logic to develop solution that
expresses your creativity. This involves a looped process of

idea -> build -> test -> reflect -> refine idea -> build -> test -> reflect etc etc

The code and your scripts are materials in tis process, they will speak to you and offer suggestions, sometimes limit, sometimes expand
your original idea.

Why Python?
-----------
Throughout these lessons we will be using Python as our programming language. Python is:

+ easy to learn and easy to use
+ has a lot of solid and dependable libraries that support creative coding
+ it is simple and powerful
+ free and open source
+ runs almost anywhere including Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi

On Purpose!
-----------
Creativity comes through playing with materials and with ideas. The purpose of such play with computers is discussed in
Harold Cohan’s article *On Purpose* and can be read here: https://www.studiointernational.com/on-purpose-an-enquiry-into-the-possible-roles-of-the-computer-in-art

Although first published in 1974, it highlights that the central concern of Harold’s original –
that of the ‘ultimate purpose’ of an artist – is still as relevant and of critical importance to creativity with computers
as it was in the 1970’s. In fact, it should be read, regularly, as a guiding light with which to inspire our creative ideas.
