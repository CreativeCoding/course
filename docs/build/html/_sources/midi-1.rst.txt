MIDI 1
======

In this lesson you will be introduced to using Midi in Python. We will concentrate on two well-established libraries:
*Mingus* and *Music21*

We will be using an internal synthesiser too, so we need to install *fluidsynth*.

Follow the instructions here https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/Download

*FluidSynth* is a MIDI synthesizer which uses SoundFont (.SF2) files to generate audio.
To get it to make a sound you will need one of these files (look here: https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/SoundFont
for simplicity we are using *GeneralUser GS v1.471.sf2* )

Once you have *fluidsynth* and have tested it works, you can move forward with the lesson.

Mingus
------
Get *mingus*
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Import mingus into your IDE using the following command::

    pip install mingus

Full docs for *mingus* can be found here https://bspaans.github.io/python-mingus/index.html

1. *Hello Mingus*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
midi-mingus-1.py

This first lesson will concentrate getting mingus to play a single note.

First import some mingus methods and sleep into a new python script in your IDE::

    from mingus.midi import fluidsynth
    from mingus.containers import Note
    from time import sleep

Then initialise the synth::

    fluidsynth.init("soundfont.SF2")

Now build a note object::

    mynote = Note("C-5")

This will instantiate a Note object (called *mynote*) and assign it the pitch C in 5th octave.
We can modify *mynote* with other Note class parameters such as midi channel, velocity, and change the pitch::

    mynote.velocity = 50
    mynote.channel = 5
    mynote.note = "D-5"

Next we can play *mynote* on Fluidsynth, but will need to stop with a stop command::

    fluidsynth.play_Note(mynote)
    sleep(1) # pause for 1 second
    fluidsynth.stop_Note(mynote)

When you run this code you should hear a piano note sound for 1 second.
