prerequisites to the course
---------------------------

This course presumes that you have some basic knowledge of computer programming and especially Python.
If you are starting from scratch then you will need to complete an 'intro to python' course elsewhere.
The basic knowledge required is an understanding of::

    object and data structures, comparison operators, statements, methods and functions, error handling, try-except-finally, object-oriented programming (classes).

It is presumed that you will be using this IDE for::

    environment management, importing libraries, and navigating the Terminal.

You will need to know how to do these before moving on with the course. If you need to "catch-up", here are some good

Format of lessons
-----------------

Each lesson pretty much focuses on a single library or single use of a library. These are split into 3 main
activities:
1) CONCEPT e.g. an explanation of a "hello world" use
2) TASK e.g. a walkthrough of a creative music application
3) EXTRA CREDIT: e.g. extended discussion of the library's API
